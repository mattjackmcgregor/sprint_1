How would i describe the command line to a lay person?
  The command line is a program that you can access, create, and manipulate the things on your computer how you normally would, but a raw more black and white version. using and communicating with your computer only through text. no picture, no buttons, nothing.

10 terminal commands
  ls - shows the items in your folder 
  pwd - shows your path of where you are located
  cd - a command for when you want to change the folders 
  touch - creates a new item within the folder you are in
  rm - removes/deletes the item
  cp - copies files
  mv - moves files
  > - overides previous content 
 < - puts content into an action
 | - puts output of a command to another command
